# Lux Eye S3

Based on code originally developed by [Jasper Van Merle](https://github.com/jmerle) 

## Development

Development on the visualizer requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to be installed. After cloning the repository (or forking and cloning) and navigating into the `lux-eye` directory, run `yarn` to install the dependencies and `yarn dev` to run a local development server. `yarn lint` is available to check for code quality and formatting issues, and `yarn fix` can be used to fix most linting issues automatically.
